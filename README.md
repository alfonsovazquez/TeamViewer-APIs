# TeamViewer-APIs
Demonstration of TeamViewer API calls 

The purpose of this project it's to demonstrate how you can use and combine TeamViewer API calls to get backend access of TeamViewer Mangement Console, as well as your TeamViewer Account (Computers & Contacts). The repository will contain a series of python scripts for all GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API calls.  

Additionally, this can also help you to create web apps to interact with TeamViewer and integrate with other systems such as CRM, ticketing systems, MDM, etc. 

Please not that I'm not a developer, I'm using official documentation from TeamViewer API Manual:

I would like for anyone interested in this project to share their thoughts and ideas.
